# Selected Projects

## Predictive Maintenance – Sensor Data Conditioning (2025)
Built preprocessing workflows for 50k+ industrial sensor time-series (noise reduction, outlier capping, reconstruction).  
Designed reliability features for downstream ML failure prediction.

---

## TrainOps Simulation Data Optimization (2024)
Developed C++/Python parsers for 200k+ simulation records.  
Reduced processing time by 70%.  
Integrated survey data + sensor logs to validate scenarios.

---

## ML Failure-Mode Prototyping (2024–25)
EDA, feature engineering, baseline classifiers (RF, SVM, GBoost).  
Early experimentation for predictive-maintenance modeling.
