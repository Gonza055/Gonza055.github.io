# Selected Projects

## Predictive Maintenance – Sensor Data Conditioning & Feature Engineering (2025)

**Context.** Industrial maintenance setting with 50k+ high-noise sensor time-series from crushing and grinding equipment.

**What I built**

- Preprocessing pipeline for noisy sensor data (smoothing, outlier capping, signal reconstruction).
- Reliability-focused feature sets (load ratios, temperature deltas, transient-spike metrics).
- Structured datasets ready for downstream failure-prediction models.

**Tech stack**

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter.
- Time-series preprocessing, feature engineering, EDA.

**Impact**

Enabled future ML experimentation for early-warning indicators and reliability analysis.

## TrainOps Simulation Data Optimization (2024)

**Context.** Data-engineering project using simulation outputs (~200k records) for rail operations planning.

**What I built**

- C++/Python parsers to convert raw simulation logs into structured, analysis-ready datasets.
- Automation workflow reducing processing time by ~70%.
- Pipelines integrating rider-survey data with onboard sensor logs for validation.

**Tech stack**

- C++, Python, Pandas, basic SQL, Git.

**Impact**

Improved scenario comparison and supported data-driven transit-planning decisions.

## ML Failure-Mode Prototyping (2024–25)

**Context.** Early experimentation for predictive-maintenance modeling inspired by industrial scenarios.

**What I built**

- EDA, feature engineering, baseline classifiers (Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting).
- Evaluation with standard metrics and visualizations.

**Tech stack**

- Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.

**Outcome**

Provided foundational experimentation for later industrial predictive-maintenance work.
