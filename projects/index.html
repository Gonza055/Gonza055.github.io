reconstruction) for noisy sensor data.</li>
  <li>A reliability-focused feature set including load ratios, temperature deltas,
and transient-spike metrics designed for condition-based maintenance.</li>
  <li>Structured datasets ready for downstream failure-prediction models.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tech stack</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Python, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter</li>
  <li>Time-series preprocessing, feature engineering, EDA</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Enabled future ML experimentation for early-warning indicators and
reliability analysis on critical assets.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="trainops">TrainOps Simulation Data Optimization</h2>

<p><strong>Context.</strong> Data-engineering project using simulation outputs from TrainOps
for rail operations planning (~200k records across multiple scenarios).</p>

<p><strong>What I built</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Python and C++ parsers to transform raw simulation outputs into structured,
analysis-ready datasets.</li>
  <li>Automation scripts that eliminated manual parsing and reduced processing time
by about 70%.</li>
  <li>Workflows to integrate rider-survey data with onboard sensor logs to validate
demand and service patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tech stack</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>C++, Python, Pandas, basic SQL, Git</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Improved clarity and speed of scenario comparison for planning teams and
supported data-driven decision-making.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pm-modeling">Predictive Maintenance Modeling Prototype (Academic)</h2>

<p><strong>Context.</strong> Academic project inspired by industrial predictive-maintenance
settings.</p>

<p><strong>What I built</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>An ML pipeline including data cleaning, noise reduction, feature engineering,
and exploratory labeling of time-series patterns.</li>
  <li>Baseline models (Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting) to test early
detection of abnormal equipment behavior.</li>
  <li>Evaluation and comparison of models using standard metrics and visualization.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tech stack</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Outcome</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Served as an experimental foundation for later industrial work on predictive
maintenance.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="honors-thesis--unsupervised-mode-discovery-in-mineral-processing-in-progress">Honors Thesis – Unsupervised Mode Discovery in Mineral Processing (In Progress)</h2>

<p><strong>Goal.</strong> Design an unsupervised-learning framework to identify operating modes
in mineral-processing circuits using plant datasets.</p>

<p><strong>Approach</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Clustering, dimensionality reduction, and statistical validation of
discovered modes.</li>
  <li>Focus on supporting performance monitoring and early detection of suboptimal
operating states.</li>
</ul>
