## About

I am a senior Computer Science student at Brigham Young University (BYU) with a
Machine Learning emphasis. My work focuses on applying ML and statistical
methods to noisy, real-world datasets from mining, transportation, and
industrial operations.

I enjoy building clean, reproducible data pipelines, designing features for
time-series and sensor data, and turning complex datasets into actionable,
engineering-grade insights.

## Highlighted Projects

### Predictive Maintenance – Sensor Data Conditioning & Feature Engineering

Industrial time-series project based on 50k+ high-noise sensor signals from
crushing and grinding equipment. Built a reproducible preprocessing workflow
with smoothing, outlier handling, and signal reconstruction, then engineered
reliability-focused features (load ratios, temperature deltas, transient-spike
metrics) to support downstream failure-prediction models.

### TrainOps Simulation Data Optimization

Data-engineering and automation project using Python and C++ to process
200k+ rail-simulation records. Developed parsers and scripts that reduced
output-processing time by ~70% compared to manual workflows, and integrated
rider-survey data with onboard sensor logs to analyze service scenarios.

---

### Predictive Maintenance Modeling Prototype (Academic)

Academic ML prototype that mirrors industrial predictive-maintenance settings.
Includes EDA, noise reduction, feature engineering, exploratory labeling of
time-series, and benchmarking of baseline models such as Random Forest, SVM,
and gradient boosting for early detection of abnormal equipment behavior.
