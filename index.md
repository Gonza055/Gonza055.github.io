# Gonzalo Loayza

**Machine Learning & Data Science · B.S. Computer Science @ BYU**

I work on predictive maintenance, large-scale time-series analysis, and data-centric ML systems for real-world engineering problems.

## What I do

- **Predictive maintenance on industrial equipment** using high-noise sensor time-series (vibration, pressure, load, temperature).
- **End-to-end data workflows**: from raw logs and messy CSVs to clean features, validation datasets, and useful dashboards.
- **Practical machine learning** for engineers: feature engineering, baselines, error analysis, and clear communication of results.

Right now I’m especially interested in **reliability analytics**, **ML for operations**, and **robust time-series modeling**.

## Highlighted projects

### Predictive Maintenance – Sensor Data Conditioning & Feature Engineering (2025)

Industrial maintenance setting with 50k+ noisy sensor time-series from crushing and grinding equipment.  
Built preprocessing workflows (smoothing, outlier capping, signal reconstruction) and engineered reliability-focused feature sets (load ratios, temperature deltas, transient spikes) to support downstream ML failure-prediction models.

### TrainOps Simulation Data Optimization (2024)

Data-engineering project using Python and C++ to process 200k+ rail-simulation records.  
Developed parsers and automation scripts that cut output-processing time by ~70% versus manual workflows and integrated survey data with onboard sensor logs to validate operational scenarios.

### Predictive Maintenance Modeling Prototype (Academic, 2024–25)

Academic ML prototype mirroring industrial predictive-maintenance settings.  
Includes EDA, noise reduction, feature engineering, exploratory labeling of time series, and benchmarking of baseline models (Random Forest, SVM, gradient boosting) for early detection of abnormal equipment behavior.

## How I work

I like projects where:

- The **data is messy** and requires real cleaning and structuring.  
- There is a clear **operational or business objective** (throughput, reliability, safety, cost).  
- Results can be explained **clearly to non-ML stakeholders**: engineers, managers, or operators.

If that sounds like your team, feel free to reach out.
