## About

I'm a senior Computer Science student at Brigham Young University (BYU) focusing on applied machine learning,
large datasets, and data-centric modeling.  
My work centers on designing end-to-end ML workflows that connect clean data pipelines with robust models and
clear evaluation.

I enjoy working on problems where data is messy, structure is not obvious, and good engineering makes the
difference between a one-off notebook and a reliable system.
