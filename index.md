## About

I'm a senior Computer Science student at Brigham Young University (BYU) specializing in machine learning for industrial and engineering applications.  
My work focuses on designing **data-centric ML pipelines** for large-scale time-series, simulation outputs, and operational datasets found in mining, rail systems, and heavy industry.

I work at the intersection of **predictive maintenance**, **reliability analytics**, and **software engineering**, building reproducible workflows that transform complex datasets into structured insights.  
I care about clarity, robustness, and engineering precision in every stage of the ML lifecycle.

  <div class="exp-item">
    <h3 class="exp-title">Maintenance Data Analyst Intern</h3>
    <p class="exp-meta">Compañía de Minas Buenaventura &middot; 2025</p>
    <p>
      Processed and analyzed 50k+ high-noise industrial sensor time-series from crushing and grinding systems.
      Built reproducible pipelines for smoothing, outlier capping, and signal reconstruction, and engineered
      reliability-focused features used for early-warning indicators and predictive-maintenance prototyping.
      Structured 100+ assets under ISO&nbsp;14224/17359 to improve traceability and maintenance workflows.
