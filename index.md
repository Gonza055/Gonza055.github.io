## About

I'm a senior Computer Science student at Brigham Young University (BYU) specializing in machine learning for industrial and engineering applications.  
My work focuses on designing **data-centric ML pipelines** for large-scale time-series, simulation outputs, and operational datasets found in mining, rail systems, and heavy industry.

I work at the intersection of **predictive maintenance**, **reliability analytics**, and **software engineering**, building reproducible workflows that transform complex datasets into structured insights.  
I care about clarity, robustness, and engineering precision in every stage of the ML lifecycle.
