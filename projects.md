## Projects

Below are selected projects that demonstrate my experience with machine learning, time-series analysis, and data-centric software development.

---

### Predictive Maintenance – Sensor Data Conditioning & Feature Engineering (2025)

**Context.** Industrial maintenance setting with 50k+ high-noise sensor time-series from crushing and grinding equipment.

**What I built**

- A reproducible preprocessing pipeline (smoothing, outlier capping, signal reconstruction) for noisy sensor data.  
- Reliability-focused feature sets including load ratios, temperature deltas, and transient-spike metrics.  
- Structured datasets ready for downstream failure-prediction models.

**Tech stack**

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter  
- Time-series preprocessing, feature engineering, EDA

**Impact**

Enabled future ML experimentation for early-warning indicators and reliability analysis.

### TrainOps Simulation Data Optimization (2024)

**Context.** Data-engineering project using simulation outputs (~200k records) for rail operations planning.

**What I built**

- Python & C++ parsers to convert raw simulation logs into structured, analysis-ready datasets.  
- Automation workflow reducing processing time by ~70%.  
- Pipelines integrating rider-survey data with onboard sensor logs for validation.

**Tech stack**

- C++, Python, Pandas, basic SQL, Git

**Impact**

Improved scenario comparison and supported data-driven transit-planning decisions.

### Predictive Maintenance Modeling Prototype (Academic)

**Context.** Academic project inspired by industrial predictive-maintenance scenarios.

**What I built**

- ML pipeline with cleaning, denoising, feature engineering, and exploratory labeling.  
- Baseline models (Random Forest, SVM, Gradient Boosting).  
- Evaluation with standard metrics plus visualization.

**Tech stack**

- Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

**Outcome**

Provided foundational experimentation for later industrial predictive maintenance work.
