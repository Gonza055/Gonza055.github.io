## Selected Projects

### Predictive Maintenance – Sensor Data Conditioning & Feature Engineering (2025)
**Context.** Industrial maintenance setting with 50k+ high-noise sensor time-series from crushing and grinding equipment.

**What I built**
- Preprocessing pipeline (smoothing, outlier capping, reconstruction)
- Reliability-focused feature sets (load ratios, temperature deltas, transient spikes)
- Structured datasets for downstream ML failure prediction

**Tech stack**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter

**Impact**
Enabled future ML experimentation for early-warning indicators and reliability analysis.

### TrainOps Simulation Data Optimization (2024)
**Context.** Data-engineering project using simulation outputs (~200k records) for rail operations planning.

**What I built**
- Python & C++ log parsers  
- Automated workflow reducing processing time by ~70%  
- Integration of rider-survey data + sensor logs

**Tech stack**
C++, Python, Pandas, basic SQL, Git

**Impact**
Supported scenario comparison and data-driven transit planning.

### Predictive Maintenance Modeling Prototype (Academic, 2024–25)
**Context.** Academic project inspired by industrial predictive-maintenance scenarios.

**What I built**
- ML cleaning, denoising, and feature engineering
- Baseline models (RF, SVM, Gradient Boosting)
- Evaluation + visualization

**Tech stack**
Python, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

**Outcome**
Foundation for later industrial predictive-maintenance work.
